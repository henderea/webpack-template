# webpack-template

## PLEASE REPLACE THIS README AND UPDATE THE METADATA IN PACKAGE.JSON AFTER COPYING

## Using

See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/henderea/764b427cde1a7fa562b7fe8427aedb51) for a script that can set up a new project with this template for you.

The script from the gist can be installed to `~/bin` with the following command (also posted in a comment on the gist):

```shell
curl -sSL "https://gist.github.com/henderea/764b427cde1a7fa562b7fe8427aedb51/raw/create-webpack.sh" -o ~/bin/create-webpack.sh
```

You can replace the path at the end of the command with another if preferred.  Make sure to mark it as executable and have the location in your `PATH`.
